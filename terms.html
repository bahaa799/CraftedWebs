    <h1>Crafted Webs Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>1. Services</h2>
        <p>Crafted Webs provides web design, logo creation, and photo editing services. We create websites that are only visual. Due to education limitations, we are hoping to bring this service later on after we perfect it.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>2. Pricing</h2>
        <p>Our pricing structure is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic Website: Starting at $200</li>
            <li>Custom Logo Design: Starting at $15</li>
            <li>Photo Editing & Retouching: Starting at $10 per picture (discounts available for multiple photos)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All prices are subject to change. Additional customization may incur extra charges. All payments must be made in U.S. dollars.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>3. Payment</h2>
        <p>Payments must be made upfront for smaller projects. For large projects, a 40% deposit is required before work begins, with the remaining balance due upon completion. Deposits are non-refundable once work has started.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Refunds are only applicable before work has begun. Once a project is in progress, partial refunds may be issued depending on the amount of work completed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>5. Revisions</h2>
        <p>Each project includes a minimum of 3 revisions at each stage of the process.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>6. Copyright and Ownership</h2>
        <p>Upon full payment, the client owns all rights to the final design.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>7. Website Publication</h2>
        <p>We are responsible for building your website. If you want your website to be published on Google, you are responsible for providing the domain name. If you want your website to be accessed through a link, we can provide that service with additional fees.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>8. Project Timelines</h2>
        <p>We provide estimated completion times for each project. However, timelines may vary based on project complexity, client responsiveness, and required revisions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>9. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Clients must provide necessary content, branding materials, and feedback in a timely manner. Delays in communication may result in extended deadlines.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>10. Rejection of Work</h2>
        <p>If a client is dissatisfied with the initial designs, they may request revisions as per the agreed-upon revision limit. If the project is rejected entirely after significant work has been done, no refunds will be issued.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>11. Termination of Services</h2>
        <p>Crafted Webs reserves the right to terminate services if a client is unresponsive for more than 10 days, engages in unethical behavior, or violates any agreed-upon terms. No refunds are issued in this case.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>12. Confidentiality & Privacy</h2>
        <p>We respect client privacy and will not share or sell personal information. However, we may display project results in our portfolio unless an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) is signed.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>13. Website Maintenance & Support</h2>
        <p>We offer maintenance and updates as a separate service. Once a website is delivered, future edits or troubleshooting may incur additional fees unless a maintenance plan is purchased.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>14. Late Fees</h2>
        <p>Payments are due according to the agreed-upon schedule. If a payment is more than 7 days late, a 10% late fee may be applied. If a payment is more than 30 days late, WebBreeze reserves the right to suspend or terminate the project.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="terms-section">
        <h2>15. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about these terms, contact us at
